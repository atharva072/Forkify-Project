# Forkify Project 🍜

A web application that tells the user about servings of a particular recipe for a given amount of people. 
While it is a fairly simple web application it is useful for people who require some assistance while preparing certain recipe.
This project was a part of "The complete Javascript course 2020" by Jonas Schmedtmann.
